#App Interfaces

The team at Computron Computing has asked you to join their product team to develop the hottest new Computron computer. 
Youâ€™ll be responsible for building some of the standard apps on this new machine, specifically the to-do list and the password manager.

---

At this point in development you have two classes started: `TodoList` representing the to-do list application and PasswordManager representing the `password manager`. 
In order to work within the Computron system, every app must have a display and reset feature. 
In other words, each class will need to implement the `IDisplayable` and `IResetable` interfaces.
